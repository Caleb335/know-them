            The Special Anti-Robbery Squad was founded in 1992 by former police
            commissioner Simeon Danladi Midenda. SARS is one of the 14 units in
            the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department which
            was established to detain, investigate and prosecute people involved
            in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping and other forms of crimes.

            In 2009, after several years of operations the squad grew in number
            and strength. Due to the surge of internet fraudsters and cultism in
            universities, SARS operatives infiltrated Nigerian universities,
            made several successful arrest but in the process harassed innocent
            youths. In May 2010, Amnesty International disclosed that it would
            be suing the Nigerian Police over human rights abuse stating that
            the Special Anti-Robbery Squad in Borokiri, Port Harcourt arrested
            three bike riders and detained them for over one week while being
            "beaten every night with the butt of a gun and iron belt."[5] On 20
            May 2010, a Federal High Court in Enugu State, ordered the then IGP
            Ogbonna Okechukwu Onovo to produce a Special Anti-Robbery Squad
            officer who had gunned down a 15 years-old boy in high school.
            According to the SARS officer, the teen was mistaken for a
            kidnapper.[6] On 27 July 2010, an extensive editorial report was
            published by Sahara Reporters on how SARS among other police unit
            profit 9.35Billion Naira ($60million) from roadblocks and extortion
            within 18 months.{" "}

            On 3 June 2011, the Nigeria Police Forced discovered an attempt by a
            SARS operative Musa Agbu to bomb the force headquarters because the
            IGP Hafiz Ringim scuttled his ambition.

            Following several reports of human rights violation by members of
            the public to the office of the Inspector General of Police, on 7
            August 2015, the then IGP Solomon Arase announced that it would be
            splitting the SARS unit into two units, operational unit and the
            investigation unit to curtail case of human rights violation. In
            September 2016, Pulse.ng compiled a report on Nigeria Police
            brutality with the heading "Meet SARS, the Police Unit with license
            to kill". The report highlighted the brutality and ignorance of the
            rules of engagement in the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. In December
            2016, Segun Awosanya started an online advocacy campaign to end SARS
            brutality in the country. Awonsanya started the online campaign with
            an hashtag, #EndSARS. The public responded well to the hashtag with
            people all over Nigeria posting their SARS experience.
