          ABOUT #ENDSARS The Special Anti-Robbery Squad was founded in 1992 by
          former police commissioner Simeon Danladi Midenda. SARS is one of the
          14 units in the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence
          Department which was established to detain, investigate and prosecute
          people involved in crimes like armed robbery, kidnapping and other
          forms of crimes.

          In 2009, after several years of operations the squad grew in number
          and strength. Due to the surge of internet fraudsters and cultism in
          universities, SARS operatives infiltrated Nigerian universities, made
          several successful arrest but in the process harassed innocent youths.
          In May 2010, Amnesty International disclosed that it would be suing
          the Nigerian Police over human rights abuse stating that the Special
          Anti-Robbery Squad in Borokiri, Port Harcourt arrested three bike
          riders and detained them for over one week while being "beaten every
          night with the butt of a gun and iron belt."[5] On 20 May 2010, a
          Federal High Court in Enugu State, ordered the then IGP Ogbonna
          Okechukwu Onovo to produce a Special Anti-Robbery Squad officer who
          had gunned down a 15 years-old boy in high school. According to the
          SARS officer, the teen was mistaken for a kidnapper.[6] On 27 July
          2010, an extensive editorial report was published by Sahara Reporters
          on how SARS among other police unit profit 9.35Billion Naira
          ($60million) from roadblocks and extortion within 18 months.{" "}

          On 3 June 2011, the Nigeria Police Forced discovered an attempt by a
          SARS operative Musa Agbu to bomb the force headquarters because the
          IGP Hafiz Ringim scuttled his ambition.

          Following several reports of human rights violation by members of the
          public to the office of the Inspector General of Police, on 7 August
          2015, the then IGP Solomon Arase announced that it would be splitting
          the SARS unit into two units, operational unit and the investigation
          unit to curtail case of human rights violation. In September 2016,
          Pulse.ng compiled a report on Nigeria Police brutality with the
          heading "Meet SARS, the Police Unit with license to kill". The report
          highlighted the brutality and ignorance of the rules of engagement in
          the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. In December 2016, Segun Awosanya
          started an online advocacy campaign to end SARS brutality in the
          country. Awonsanya started the online campaign with an hashtag,
          #EndSARS. The public responded well to the hashtag with people all
          over Nigeria posting their SARS experience.
